    <p>
      I am a robotics-focused engineer with a strong interdisciplinary
      background in mechanical engineering, applied mathematics, and
      computer science. I graduated from the University of Massachusetts
      Amherst with three bachelor’s degrees and a minor in business,
      which has given me both technical depth and a broad systems-level
      perspective.

    <p>
      My interest in robotics began in high school through participation
      in the BOTBALL robotics competition. Designing and building autonomous
      robots from LEGO and metal components sparked my curiosity about how
      machines can perceive, reason, and act in the physical world. That
      experience motivated me to pursue the technical foundation needed
      to build real-world robotic systems.

      Through my academic training, I have developed hands-on experience
      with CAD, finite element analysis using ANSYS, and core engineering
      design principles. My coursework and projects span mechanical design,
      numerical methods, algorithms, and software development, allowing me
      to approach problems from both hardware and software perspectives.

    <p>
      I have also gained industry experience as an intern at Amazon,
      working on AWS Redshift, where I contributed to large-scale systems
      in a production environment. This experience strengthened my skills
      in software engineering, collaboration, and building reliable tools
      at scale.
    </p>

    <p>
      My long-term goal is to advance the field of robotics through research
      while also teaching and mentoring others. I am deeply motivated by
      the idea of making robotics more accessible and inspiring the next
      generation of engineers—just as I was inspired to pursue this field.
